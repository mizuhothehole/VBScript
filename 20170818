VBScript showing hello world in client.

<html>
<body>
<script type="text/vbscript">
document.write("this is my first vbscript")
</script>
</bod>
</html>

IE->F12->document mode IE5-> 
now we can see the output of the code we wrote!

So, As I wrote here:
this is my first vbscript.

So this is my second vbscript:

<html>
<body>
<script type="text/vbscript">
Dim a
a = "ni hao ma"
b = 123
i = 1
alert(a & b)
Do while(i < 10)
document.write(i)
document.write("</br>")
i = i + 1
Loop
document.write("---------------------")
document.write("</br>")
Dim b
b = 10

Do until(b = 1)
document.write(b)
document.write("</br>")
b = b - 1
Loop

document.write(a)
document.write("this is an actionscript!")
</script>
</body>
</html>

After rendered by browser, it is like this:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
---------------------
10
9
8

ni hao mathis is an actionscript! 

That looks cool, is it?
So we can use almost everything about VB6.0 in the vbscript. But infact it is abondoned by microsoft. Why is it? I do not know.
We can see we must use the document mode of the browser 5 IE emulation to run these scripts. So it is really a funny thing for us
to do these old things.
Well. Seems it is having the Do Loop which even you did not know how many times you should loop. And if you write the while and
until in different places the results are also changing as if you wrote after DO, it will at least run once. But if you wrote it
after Loop, it will run just like For scentences.
